## Some Observations about this Application Web
1 - The backend of this project is not finished, the focus here of the project is the concepts of the integration of the angle with Typescript, nodejs. The backend is being done with json creating items from a registration form that has not been fully implemented. Only the dependencies were included in the json package and the components created and imported in the general controller app.module.ts as well as the routes(app-routing.module.ts) and the server components.
## Functionalities
-	We have a drug prevention project for info comunnity;
-	community projects carried out where the training courses are located whether voluntary;
-	 registration and form;
-	It is intended to end the backend by updating the forms and updating the user registration and creating other routes for navigation using the material design and bindings.
